Each institution has its own script for now because they make their data available in different ways.

* BAS: `wget` works. Nice and simple.
  *  `download_all_bas.sh` will downline every segment listed in the index files (data/BAS/*.csv)
  * Index files for a new season can be downloaded from rammada:
    * click the "Folder" dropdown next to "netcdf"
    * Select "All Actions"
    * Select "CSV"; download into data/BAS/netcdf_indices; renaming file to [survey].csv
